# Balls and Holes


This is my first game. It is designed to be highly addictive. You can play it here: https://slukas23.github.io/balls-and-holes/




## Instructions:

:point_right: Press __ENTER__ to shoot!

:point_right: You have __3 lives__ (HEALTH). Actually 4, zero is your bonus life! 




The aim is to shoot the ball inside the hole. To get through the circle spinning around the hole,
you must make sure that the colors match. In order to do so, the color of the hole must match the color of the circle spinning around it.
After each successful hit the rotation speed increases.

## Technology:

I used Canvas / P5 and little bit of DOM manipulation.
